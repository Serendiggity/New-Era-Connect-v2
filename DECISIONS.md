# Technical Decisions Log

This document tracks all significant technical decisions made during the development of New Era Connect.

## 2024-01-09 - Project Architecture: Monorepo with Feature-Sliced Design

**Context:** Starting the New Era Connect project from scratch, needed to establish a clean, scalable architecture that supports AI-assisted development.

**Decision:** 
- Implemented a monorepo structure with three workspaces: `client`, `server`, and `shared`
- Adopted feature-sliced design pattern for the backend with features organized in `server/src/features/`
- Each feature contains its own routes and services following a consistent pattern

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Separate repositories for frontend and backend (rejected due to complexity in shared types)
- Single workspace structure (rejected due to dependency management complexity)
- Domain-driven design (rejected as overly complex for initial implementation)

**Rationale:**
- Monorepo enables easy sharing of types between frontend and backend
- Feature-sliced design promotes modularity and maintainability
- Consistent patterns make it easier for AI assistants to understand and extend code
- Workspace structure allows independent deployment while maintaining cohesion

**Consequences:**
- Simplified development workflow with shared types
- Clear separation of concerns between features
- Easier to onboard new developers or AI assistants
- Some complexity in build and deployment processes

## 2024-01-09 - Database Schema: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL

**Context:** Needed a robust database solution with type safety and good integration with the TypeScript ecosystem.

**Decision:** 
- PostgreSQL as the primary database
- Drizzle ORM for database interactions
- Schema-first approach with Zod validation
- Centralized schema definition in `shared/schema.ts`

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Prisma (rejected due to preference for lighter weight solution)
- TypeORM (rejected due to decorator-heavy approach)
- Raw SQL (rejected due to lack of type safety)

**Rationale:**
- Drizzle provides excellent TypeScript integration with minimal runtime overhead
- PostgreSQL offers reliability and advanced features needed for the application
- Schema-first approach ensures consistency between database and application types
- Zod integration provides runtime validation

**Consequences:**
- Strong type safety throughout the application
- Easier database migrations and schema evolution
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Drizzle
- Excellent developer experience with auto-completion and type checking

## 2024-01-09 - Frontend Architecture: React with ShadCN/UI

**Context:** Needed a modern, accessible UI framework that can be rapidly developed and easily maintained.

**Decision:**
- React as the frontend framework
- Vite as the build tool
- ShadCN/UI for component library
- TanStack Query for server state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Clerk for authentication

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Next.js (rejected due to preference for SPA approach)
- Vue.js (rejected due to team familiarity with React)
- Material-UI (rejected in favor of more customizable solution)
- Ant Design (rejected due to design preferences)

**Rationale:**
- React provides excellent developer experience and ecosystem
- ShadCN/UI offers beautiful, accessible components with full customization
- TanStack Query handles server state management efficiently
- Tailwind CSS enables rapid UI development
- Clerk provides robust authentication without custom implementation

**Consequences:**
- Rapid development of beautiful, accessible interfaces
- Consistent design system across the application
- Excellent developer experience with hot reloading and type safety
- Dependency on external services (Clerk) for authentication

## 2024-01-09 - Authentication Strategy: Clerk with JIT User Provisioning

**Context:** Required secure authentication with minimal setup complexity and good developer experience.

**Decision:**
- Clerk for authentication and user management
- Just-in-Time (JIT) user provisioning in the database
- Global middleware for user creation (`ensureUserExists`)
- Session-based authentication with automatic user creation

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Auth0 (rejected due to cost and complexity)
- Firebase Auth (rejected due to vendor lock-in concerns)
- Custom authentication (rejected due to security complexity)
- NextAuth.js (rejected due to framework dependency)

**Rationale:**
- Clerk provides excellent developer experience with minimal setup
- JIT provisioning ensures users exist in our database without manual intervention
- Session-based approach integrates well with our API architecture
- Reduces security risks by leveraging proven authentication service

**Consequences:**
- Simplified authentication implementation
- Automatic user management reduces manual overhead
- Dependency on external service for critical functionality
- Excellent user experience with social login options

## 2024-01-09 - File Storage Strategy: Supabase Storage

**Context:** Needed reliable file storage for business card images with good integration capabilities.

**Decision:**
- Supabase for file storage and PostgreSQL hosting
- Signed URLs for secure file access
- Storage integration with existing PostgreSQL database
- CDN capabilities for global file delivery

**Alternatives Considered:**
- AWS S3 (rejected due to setup complexity)
- Google Cloud Storage (rejected due to cost concerns)
- Local file system (rejected due to scalability issues)
- Cloudinary (rejected due to cost for storage volume)

**Rationale:**
- Supabase provides unified database and storage solution
- Excellent PostgreSQL compatibility with advanced features
- Built-in CDN and security features
- Cost-effective for startup and scale-up phases

**Consequences:**
- Simplified infrastructure management
- Excellent performance for file uploads and access
- Unified platform reduces complexity
- Some vendor lock-in considerations for future scaling

## 2024-01-09 - AI Integration Approach: OpenAI with Modular Services

**Context:** Required AI capabilities for business card OCR and email generation with flexibility for future enhancements.

**Decision:**
- OpenAI API for text processing and generation
- Modular service architecture for AI features
- Centralized AI service layer in `server/src/services/ai.ts`
- Structured prompts with consistent formatting

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Google Cloud AI (rejected due to API complexity)
- AWS AI services (rejected due to fragmentation)
- Custom ML models (rejected due to development time)
- Multiple AI providers (rejected due to initial complexity)

**Rationale:**
- OpenAI provides state-of-the-art capabilities for text processing
- Modular architecture allows easy switching or addition of AI services
- Centralized service layer provides consistent AI integration
- Structured approach enables predictable AI behavior

**Consequences:**
- Powerful AI capabilities with minimal development effort
- Flexible architecture for future AI enhancements
- Dependency on external AI service for core functionality
- Need for careful prompt engineering and testing
