# Database Setup - Final Steps

Due to network limitations in this environment, I couldn't directly connect to your Supabase database. However, I've prepared everything you need to complete the setup manually.

## ✅ What I've Done

1. **Created complete Drizzle schema** in `shared/schema.ts` with:
   - All table definitions
   - TypeScript types
   - Zod validation schemas

2. **Updated middleware** in `server/src/middleware/ensure-user-exists.ts`:
   - New users automatically assigned to default organization

3. **Generated SQL schema** in `database-schema.sql`:
   - Complete database structure
   - Includes default organization seed

## 🚀 Complete Setup in 2 Steps

### Step 1: Run SQL in Supabase

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. Click **New query**
5. Copy and paste the entire contents of `database-schema.sql`
6. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter)

You should see success messages indicating:
- All tables created
- Default organization created
- Indexes created

### Step 2: Verify Setup

Run this command to open Drizzle Studio and view your tables:

```bash
npm run db:studio
```

This will open a browser window where you can:
- See all your tables
- Verify the default organization exists
- View table relationships

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Your database is now fully set up with:
- ✅ 13 tables for all features
- ✅ Multi-tenant architecture
- ✅ Default organization (ID: 1)
- ✅ All indexes for performance
- ✅ Type-safe Drizzle ORM integration

You can now start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 📝 Notes

- All new users will automatically be assigned to organization ID 1
- The schema supports future multi-tenancy without changes
- Your Clerk users will be synced to the database on first login
- Business card statuses track the full OCR workflow as specified
