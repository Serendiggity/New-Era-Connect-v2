title: Documentation Tracking Rules

This rule ensures AI assistants maintain proper documentation throughout the project.

## Required Documentation Files

### 1. DECISIONS.md (Project Root)
**CRITICAL:** Every significant technical decision MUST be logged in `DECISIONS.md` using this format:
```markdown
### [Date] - Decision Title
**Context:** Why this decision was needed
**Decision:** What we decided
**Alternatives Considered:** Other options we evaluated
**Rationale:** Why we chose this approach
**Consequences:** What this means for the project
```

Examples of decisions that MUST be logged:
- Architecture patterns or changes
- Library/framework selections
- API design choices
- Database schema decisions
- Deployment configurations
- Performance optimizations
- Security implementations

### 2. Feature README Files
Each feature in `server/features/[feature]/` MUST have a `README.md`. Use the template at `server/features/README_TEMPLATE.md`.

Required sections:
- Purpose
- API Endpoints (with auth requirements, params, responses)
- Database Tables
- Service Methods
- Dependencies (internal and external)
- Error Handling
- Testing scenarios
- Performance considerations
- Security notes

### 3. Update Tracking

When making changes:
1. **Before implementing:** Check if this requires a DECISIONS.md entry
2. **During implementation:** Update feature README as you code
3. **After implementation:** 
   - Verify DECISIONS.md is updated
   - Ensure feature README is complete
   - Update any affected documentation

### 4. Documentation Standards

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Date all entries
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Consider future developers (including AI assistants)

## Enforcement

**DO NOT** proceed with implementation if:
- A significant decision hasn't been documented
- The feature README is missing or incomplete
- Cross-feature impacts haven't been noted

Remember: Good documentation is as important as good code in an AI-assisted development environment.
