# PR: Implement Multi-Tenant Database Schema

## Overview

This PR implements a comprehensive database schema for New Era Connect, adding support for multi-tenancy, detailed analytics tracking, and all features required for the business card management system.

## Key Changes

### 1. Database Schema (`shared/schema.ts`)
- ✅ Added 13 tables with complete Drizzle ORM definitions
- ✅ Implemented proper TypeScript types and Zod validation
- ✅ Added support for multi-tenancy with organizations table
- ✅ Included analytics tables (daily_stats, activity_logs)
- ✅ Added proper enums for status tracking (card_status, email_status)

### 2. Core Tables Implemented
- **organizations** - Multi-tenancy support
- **users** - Synced from Clerk with org assignment
- **events** - Conference/networking event tracking
- **business_cards** - Upload tracking with OCR confidence
- **contacts** - Lead management with verification workflow
- **lead_groups** - Contact grouping for campaigns
- **email_templates** - Campaign templates
- **email_drafts** - AI-generated drafts with status tracking
- **gmail_connections** - OAuth token storage
- **daily_stats** - Dashboard analytics
- **activity_logs** - Detailed audit trail

### 3. Infrastructure Updates
- Updated `package.json` with database scripts
- Updated `drizzle.config.ts` to latest syntax
- Added seed script for default organization
- Updated `ensure-user-exists.ts` middleware for org assignment

### 4. Documentation
- Created `DATABASE_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide
- Created `MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md` - Multi-tenancy migration path
- Added `database-schema.sql` - Direct SQL for Supabase
- Updated `DECISIONS.md` with database design rationale

## Migration Strategy

The schema uses a "default organization" approach:
- All users are assigned to org_id = 1 initially
- Single-user operation works immediately
- Multi-tenancy can be enabled later without schema changes

## Setup Instructions

1. Run the SQL in `database-schema.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Verify with `npm run db:studio`
3. Start development with `npm run dev`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Database tables created successfully in Supabase
- [ ] Default organization (ID: 1) exists
- [ ] New users are assigned to default org
- [ ] All indexes are created
- [ ] Drizzle Studio shows correct schema

## Breaking Changes

None - this is the initial database implementation.

## Dependencies Added

- `drizzle-orm` - ORM for type-safe database queries
- `drizzle-kit` - Database migration tools
- `postgres` - PostgreSQL driver
- `@supabase/supabase-js` - Supabase client
- `drizzle-zod` - Zod schema generation

## Future Considerations

- RBAC implementation when needed
- Additional indexes based on query patterns
- Data archival strategy for analytics
- Backup and recovery procedures
